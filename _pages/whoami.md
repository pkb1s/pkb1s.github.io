My name is Petros Koutroumpis and I currently work as a Red Teamer. My main areas of interest are Active Directory and Windows post-exploitation.

I am always up to discuss cool new ideas so feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pkb1s).

You can also find some of my work on my [Github](https://github.com/pkb1s) page.
